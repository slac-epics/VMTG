Timing tests with respect to PNET module.

I don't have a spec that tells me anything
about the phase relationship of the 360Hz
interrupt trigger (VMTG) with respect to
the fiducial. So the best we can do ATM is
measuring the VMTG IRQ phase with respect
to the PNET interrupt and then adjust the
VMTG delay so that we get the usual
150us post PNET arrival.

a)  CSR0_IRG = 0 (falling edge of 360Hz signal)
    INTIPRSC = 0
    INTIDLY  = 0
   vmtgIRQTime - pnetIRQTime = 2.36ms

b) set prescaler to 80 so the delay is conveniently
   in microseconds.
    INTIPRSC = 80
    INTIDLY  = 80
   -> still 2.36ms as expected

c) set delay to 1/360Hz - 2360us + 150us ~= 570us
    INTIPRSC = 80
    INTIDLY  = 570
   vmtgIRQTime - pnetIRQTime = 158us

Then also adjust TSZDDLY so that PNET and VMTG
timeslot numbers match. The VMTG's TS counter
increments synchronously with the VMTG interrupt.
Use VMTG_TSDIFF PV to read offset from PNET to
VMTG interrupt.
